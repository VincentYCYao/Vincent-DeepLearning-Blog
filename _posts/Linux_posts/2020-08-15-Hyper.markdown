# Hyper: an Electron-based terminal

[Hyper](https://hyper.is) is an Electron-based terminal

* Built on HTML/CSS/JS

* Fully extensible

* Install themes and plugins from the command line

## Easy Configuration

Configuration of plugins, themes, and all other things can be done by editing `.hyper.js`

```bash
nano ~/.hyper.js
```

## Amazing Plugins & Theme (my choices)

Plugins installation is simple, just type in:

```
hyper i [plugin name]
```

Below are the plugins I am using. For more, go to the [plugins table](https://hyper.is/plugins/newest).
