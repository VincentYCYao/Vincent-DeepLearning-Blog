# Research Projects

## (ongoing) Building a automatic grading system for Osteoarthritis: an MRI+AI study

### Updates

* **[Oct 27 2020]** a prototype for automatic cartilage thickness quantification is under beta test, using both public MRI data from OAI and non-public data collected in Prince of Wales Hospital, N.T., Hong Kong



## (2019-2020) Altered Topological Properties and Functional Connectivity Correlated with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

*(This work was done during my MPhil program, and also the main part of my MPhil thesis.)*

### Paper

Drafting a journel paper...

### Objectives

To be added...

### Results

To be added after the submission of the paper.



## (2018-2019) Default Mode Network Reconfiguration in Patients with Poststroke Depressive Symptoms

*(This work was done as part of my MPhil program, a collaborative clinical research project. Many thanks to Dr. Yan LIANG for her great effort.)*
